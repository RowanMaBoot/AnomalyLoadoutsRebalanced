; Edit this file to overhaul the base loadout.
; If you want to maintain the current selection of equipment, but want to add new equipment, look into /modsupport/ subfolders for each faction
; The modsupport/loadout_additions_tier.ltx are blank by default, but can be overridden with new additions, or injected into via DLTX to add extra equipment

; Case example for editing these files:
; Asymmetry. You don't want the Army to use the same tier system, so you replace the primary loadouts in the desired files (you'll want to overwrite them)

; If you just want to add mod support, don't edit these files
