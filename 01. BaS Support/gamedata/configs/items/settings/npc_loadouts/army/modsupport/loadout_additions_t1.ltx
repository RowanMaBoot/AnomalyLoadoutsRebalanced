; Loadout Additions
; la_[rank]_primary_[faction firstletter]
; The section/s included in this file are inherited by the loadout_by_rank sections in the parent directory
; Any additions here will be added to the parent sections - for example stalker_novice_primary

; BaS support by default uses these files to add BaS weapons, without interfering with other changes (for example, option asymmetry changes)
; If you don't want to conflict with the provided BaS mod support, or other mods that edit this file, use DLTX

; Using DLTX, you can add a single weapon to this section without directly editing this file,
; making the changes agnostic to say the default BaS compat provided with this mod
