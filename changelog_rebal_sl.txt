2.0.1
- Monolith no longer use or spawn with the K98
- Monolith no longer use or spawn with the G43
- Monolith legends are now twice as likely to spawn with Gauss rifles
- Novice Mercenaries no longer spawn with a pistol or shotgun as a primary, and another as a secondary
# BaS Support
- BaS weapons added to sidearm profiles for various factions
- Expanded Novices across the board to use some of the new firearms (pistols, toz)

2.0.0 (beta)
- First 'Reloaded' release, an overhaul of how loadouts work in the background.
~~~ Use of wildcards and subfolders to split up where loadouts are stored, and how they are loaded.
~~~ A patch can make an edit to a specific rank for a specific faction now, rather than the entire faction at once. BaS patches for example no longer ovewrite
~~~ BaS patching is now done under modsupport, for example. Work in progress.
- Complete restructure to make patches and other changes easier, and to avoid conflicts.
- Advanced Monolith Option during install - makes Monolith stronk.
- Lots and lots of work went into this restructure. Expect more customisation soon. DLTX support also coming soon - not included for now.

1.3.0
- Added BaS 'Patch'/ correctly version

1.2.0
- Added Army Optional "Better Armed Soldiers" addon, which strips Army of surpluse/WW2 firearms (still maintaining Modernised SVT40 and SKS variants, however) and gives novices access to standardised equipment.
- There is also a "Strong Army NPC Loadouts" optional addon, that buffs Army even more (specifically Novice through to Veteran the most)

Notable changes within both add-ons
-- Removed Pistols, TOZ, Mosin, SKS, SVT and Kiparis variants from Novice, Trainee, and Experienced ARMY NPCs.
-- ARMY NPCs can spawn with AK74Us at Novice and Trainee ranks now, with high probability.

- Army Novices use:
-- MP133, Fort500 Shotguns
-- Modernized SKS with FMJ, old rounds or a random round type (33% for each)
-- Bizon with FMJ, or old rounds
-- Vityaz with FMJ, or old rounds
-- Old AK74U with FMJ 25% chance, or AK74U with old rounds 75% chance.
- Army Trainees use:
-- MP133, Fort500 Shotguns
-- Modernized SKS with FMJ, random rounds, or a scope
-- Bizon with FMJ, or old rounds
-- Vityaz with FMJ, or old rounds
-- Old AK74U with FMJ 25% chance, Old AK74U with old rounds 25% chance, or a random round type selected with a 50% chance.
-- AK74U with FMJ 33% chance, AK74U with old rounds 66% chance

Strong is similar to the above, but even better - Novices get access to AK74s, and higher ranks get access to even better fast. Military therefore is stronger yet in online combat.

1.11.0

Changes:
- Summary - All
-- Overhauled weapon attachments & ammo dstribution to be less random, but also the selections to be more diverse.
--- Some loadouts will now feature primarily unmodded weapons, with higher ranks having more than just a silencer or scope attachment.
--- NPCs tend to use more old ammo now.
-- Snipers have been added to loadouts for all factions
-- Increased variety of novice/trainee shotgun loadouts slightly (ammo type, chance of spawning with bm16, toz34, etc).
-- Increase prevalence of bolt action rifles, semi-automatic rifles and other changes of this nature across all ranks.
-- Tweaked pistol variety across the board for novice stalkers, resulting in greater distinction across factions.
-- Added silenced pistols as a possible weapon for novice stalkers.
